GenAI you will use to

1. Speed up your workflows

2. Enhance your code efficiency

3. Help with debugging and refactoring

Day 1: Focus on 4 Different Packages/Libraries

1.  Pandas (comes from “Panel Data Analysis” hence the name)

    - Matplotlib is the powerhouse OG, but Seaborn makes it easier to
      write visualizations and can make them

2.  Matplotlib: The OG, the classic cookbook for visualizing data in
    clean, simple charts

3.  Seaborn: based on matplotlib, but simpler to use (Seaborn is an
    extension package and the plots look prettier)

4.  Plotly: This is the interactive dish, bringing visualizations
    available to your audience and allowing them to learn more about the
    data just by hovering over data points, and so on.
