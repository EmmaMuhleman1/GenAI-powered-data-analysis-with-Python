Day 1: Focus on 4 Different Packages/Libraries

1.  Pandas (comes from “Panel Data Analysis” hence the name)
    - Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, providing flexible data structures like DataFrames for cleaning, transforming, and exploring datasets.

2.  Matplotlib: The OG, the classic cookbook for visualizing data in
    clean, simple charts
    - Matplotlib is the powerhouse OG for creating a wide variety of static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

3.  Seaborn: based on matplotlib, but simpler to use (Seaborn is an
    extension package and the plots look prettier)
    - Seaborn builds on Matplotlib and makes it easier to write visualizations with attractive default styles and additional plot types.

4.  Plotly: This is the interactive dish, bringing visualizations
    available to your audience and allowing them to learn more about the
    data just by hovering over data points, and so on.
